4. What tasks are implemented?

   * Describe your monster's strategy for intercepting the rogue:
   		The monster tries to find the shortest path from its current location to the current location of rogue and moves toward the rogue.

   * Describe your rogue's strategy for evading the monster
   		The rogue tries to greedily move away from the monster, always move in to a loop corridor if the rogue is near the entrance.

5. What tasks are attempted but did not finish?
	I think I finish all of tasks such as Graph.java, GraphSearch.java, Map.java, Monster.java, and Rogue.java.

6. What tasks are left without trying?
	I don't left any task without trying. 

7. What are the known bugs in your code?
	Because this is milestone_1, its requirement looks like a basical chase game, so my monster and rogue are not very smart. So, the rogue may be killed by monster quickly. 

8. Other comments.
	There are so many inputs in the website!!!! 
	Because I don't have enough time to show all of the terminal sessions, I just show the A,B,C,D,E,F monsters.
